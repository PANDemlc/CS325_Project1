3-point lines in Portland 'not the same distance,' NCAA says
The game between NC State and Texas had different 3-point lines distances on the court, causing discrepancies. Coaches had the choice to play with the error or delay for fixing. Teams shot better on the correct line. The NCAA will investigate the error caused by a vendor before further games.
