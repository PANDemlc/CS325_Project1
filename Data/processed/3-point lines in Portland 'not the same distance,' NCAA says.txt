3-point lines in Portland 'not the same distance,' NCAA says
During the NC State vs. Texas game, it was revealed that the 3-point lines on the court were of different distances, affecting shooting percentages. Coaches were given the choice to play with the discrepancy or wait for correction, ultimately opting to continue the game. An error by a vendor led to the issue, which the NCAA will investigate. Lines at the Moda Center will be remeasured for future games.
