Jen Pawol one call away from being first woman MLB umpire
Umpire Jen Pawol, after eight seasons in the minor leagues, has been assigned to work in the Grapefruit League during spring training. This represents a significant step towards potentially becoming the first woman to umpire a regular-season Major League Baseball game. Pawol is focused on her job performance rather than breaking barriers.
