Shohei Ohtani optimistic about recovery after mashing HRs in BP
Shohei Ohtani took his first on-field batting practice with the Los Angeles Dodgers, hitting 10 out of 21 pitches over the fence. He aims to be ready for the season opener despite his previous elbow surgery. Ohtani will not pitch this season due to the surgery but is expected to return as a two-way player in 2025.
