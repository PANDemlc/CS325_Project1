Shohei Ohtani optimistic about recovery after mashing HRs in BP
Shohei Ohtani took on-field batting practice with the Dodgers for the first time since elbow surgery, hitting 10 out of 21 pitches over the fence. Despite signing a record $700 million contract, he won't pitch this season. Ohtani aims to play in the Dodgers' opener on March 20 after recovering well.
