Steelers release three players, including QB Mitch Trubisky
The Steelers released quarterback Mitch Trubisky, offensive lineman Chukwuma Okorafor, and punter Pressley Harvin, saving nearly $13 million in salary cap space. Trubisky struggled as a backup in 2023, losing his starting spot to Mason Rudolph. Kenny Pickett is now the only quarterback on the roster.
